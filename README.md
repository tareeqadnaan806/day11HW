# DOM keyCode mini project

this project describes as if we click any key on the keyboard it shows what key we have pressed and also the key of that code

so in this project i have used keydown event i have added keydown to the window as window.addEventListener and then passes an event to the key 
to get the key value we have a keyword as "key" to acess it we called "e.key"
to get the keycode we have a keyword as "keyCode" to acess it we called as "e.keyCode"

it looks like a fun project hope you likes it
